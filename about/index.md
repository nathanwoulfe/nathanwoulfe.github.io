I'm Nathan, I build things for the internet.

I'm a Level 2 certified Umbraco developer with a passion for user interface development. I am a massive advocate for Umbraco and open source software. 

I like to do things differently but not at the expense of best practices. 

I work full-time in the web development space within the tertiary education sector. Our team remains as nimble as possible within what is essentially a corporate environment, balancing internal machinations with the needs of our internal and external users (and our desire to build cool features).

I also write a weekly careers and employment column for APN Australia Regional Media, which is syndicated throughout Queensland and northern New South Wales. When I'm not lazy, those columns will be posted here.

I'm available for freelance and consulting work and am always happy to discuss potential projects.
