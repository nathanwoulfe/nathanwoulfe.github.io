I'm Nathan, I build things for the internet.

I'm a Level 2 certified Umbraco developer with a passion for user interface development. I am a massive advocate for Umbraco and open source software. 

I like to do things differently but not at the expense of best practices. 

I work full-time in web development within the tertiary education sector, building web stuff for [USC](www.usc.edu.au)

I'm available for freelance and consulting work and am always happy to discuss potential projects.
