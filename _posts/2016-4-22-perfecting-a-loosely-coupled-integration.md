title: Perfecting a loosely coupled integration

Just because we're pushing data into a third-party system, doesn't mean our user should be force to interact with said system.

This is even more relevant when the experience we (I'm using the royal we, just so everyone feels warm and included) can offer a more pleasant user experience in our own environment.

We also don't want to lose our dear user to another tab, window or website. We want to keep them in our little corner of the internet for as long as possible.
