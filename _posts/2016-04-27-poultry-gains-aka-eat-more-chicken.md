title: Poultry Gains - aka eat more chicken
---

If you want to get big, you need to eat big. There's not really much more to say. 

[Poultry Gains - check it](http://poultrygains.nathanw.com.au).

If you really care, it's a simple AngularJS single-pager, with the backend data plucked from a Google spreadsheet. The form field styling and concept comes from a [Codrops experiment](https://github.com/codrops).
